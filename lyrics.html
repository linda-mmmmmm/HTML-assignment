    <h1>City of Stars</h1> <!--verse 1-->
    <h2>Song by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling</h2> <!--singers-->
    <p>City of stars</p>
    <p>Are you shining just for me? </p>
    <p>City of stars </p>
    <p>There's so much that I can't see</p>
    <p>Who knows?</p>
    <p>I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you</p>
    <p>That now, our dreams</p>
    <p>They've finally come true</p>
    <p>City of stars</p> <!--verse 2-->
    <p>Just one thing everybody wants</p>
    <p>There in the bars</p>
    <p>And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants</p>
    <p>It's love</p>
    <p>Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else</p>
    <p>A rush, a glance</p>
    <p>A touch, a dance</p>
    <p>A look in somebody's eyes</p>
    <p>To light up the skies</p>
    <p>To open the world and send it reeling</p> <!--the end-->
